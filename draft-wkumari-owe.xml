    <section title="tl;dr / Executive summary">
      <t>This (colloquial) summary will be removed before publication: </t>

      <t>Currently, there are many open/unencrypted public WiFi networks,
      designed for "ease of use" in places such as coffee shops, libraries,
      etc. When a user connects to whatever open SSID sounds likely ("Central
      Perk," for instance), they have are using an unencrypted connection and
      their browsing data can be readily viewed by any other user on the same
      unencrypted network, simply by using a networks sniffing tool, like
      Wireshark. </t>

      <t>While users *should* use a VPN, many do not. Places that provide
      public WiFi access *should* only provide an encrypted SSID, and print
      the passphrase on the wall or receipts (or similar), but, well, they are
      a coffee shop, and want to provide easy access to everyone who buys an
      espresso...</t>

      <t>This document defines a new, opportunistically encrypted mode for
      WiFi networks. The SSID will still appear to be open (there will not be
      a "lock" icon when scanning), but will actually be encrypted, using the
      SSID as the passphrase. Software running on the client will detect that
      this is an opportunistically encrypted connection and will automagically
      provide the SSID as the passphrase, providing an encrypted connection
      without any interaction from the user. This system leverages existing
      WiFi protocols and WPA2, the only change is in operational practices and
      the client UI.</t>

      <section title="FAQ / Common questions / Notes">
        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t
            hangText="But everyone uses the same password. This hasn't helped at all...">Nope,
            WPA2 takes care of generating a unique key between AP and each
            client</t>

            <t hangText="This is vulnerable to the fake AP attack. ">Yes, yes
            it is. Because the connection is not authenticated, an attacker
            can stand up a fake AP with the same SSID (and passphrase). We are
            not trying to solve for active, man in the middle attacks, we are
            instead trying to thwart passive eavesdroppers. This is much of
            the justification for OWE connections specifically not getting a
            "lock" icon, there is no (obvious) feedback to the user that they
            are now getting encryption.</t>

            <t
            hangText="... and an attacker can force the user to disassociate and watch the reconnection">Yup.
            See above.</t>

            <t hangText="This isn't really opportunistic">Yes, but I wanted a
            cool acronym - actually I wanted it to be OWL but was not able to
            figure out non-contrived set of words to create that. This has
            many of the same properties of "opportunistic encryption" - it is
            unauthenticated, is mainly designed to deal with passive
            listeners, doesn't require interaction from the user, etc. </t>

            <t hangText="This belonges in $SDO">I have had a number of
            discussions with people from other standards bodies and it seems
            like the IETF may be the best place for this (for now at least).
            This solution does not require changes to underlying transport,
            rather it leverages existing technologies created by the IEEE and
            WiFi Alliance.</t>

    <section title="Introduction / Background">
      <t>As of time of this writing it is very common for users to connect to
      so called "open" wireless networks, for example in coffee shops, hotels,
      airports and similar. These networks provide no encryption, which means
      that the user's traffic is visible to anyone nearby with packet capture
      software, for example, Wireshark. It is also trivial for an attacker to
      perform a Man-in-the-middle attacks as they can see all of the user's
      traffic.</t>

      <t>There are a number of solutions to this problem, such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi
      Protected Access II), but these require either obtaining a passphrase
      from the network operator (WPA-Personal / Pre-Shared Key (PSK) mode) or
      having valid credentials for the network (WPA-Enterprise /
      WPA-802.1X).</t>

      <t>While these provide good security, for convenience reasons network
      operators often deploy open / unencrypted networks for public or "guest"
      use. This allows the public or visitors to get Internet access without
      having to ask for a passphrase, look around for one printed on a receipt
      or similar. Instead of chastising network operators for providing
      insecure access, this document provides a method to implement
      unauthenticated, encrypted network access.</t>

    <section title="OWE protected networks">
      <t>In order to provide an encrypted connection using OWE, the network
      operator creates an SSID with the (WPA2 / 802.11i <xref
      target="IEEE.802-11i"/>) pre-shared key identical to the SSID. As part
      of the WPA2 protocol the wireless client (STAtion) and Access Point (AP)
      derive a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which provides an encrypted
      "channel" between the client and AP.</t>

        Point will include the OWE Vendor-specific Information Element in

        <t>An Access Point that includes the OWE Vendor-specific Information
        Element in beacon frames is signalling that is supports OWE on that

        (STAtions) connecting to OWE enabled networks MUST use the SSID as the
        PSK, and MUST NOT display a "lock" icon in the list of SSIDs when
        scanning. User Interfaces MAY provide some feedback that this is an
        OWE protected network, but this should not be too prominent to avoid
        users assuming that they are getting more security than they actually
        are [TODO(WK): Clean this up ]</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[ To be completed after discussions ]</t>

      <t>Currently the OWE Vendor-specific Information Element is using type
      1, sub-type 0 under the AUTH-SERVERS OUI. This is to allow
      experimentation with OWE without squatting on the IANA OUI. If OWE
      progresses within the IETF, and the IESG chooses, I'm fine to place this
      under the IANA OUI, or for it to remain under AUTH-SERVERS. It's all
      just numbers.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This solution does not protect against so called "fake AP" attacks.
      Wireless networks that use PSKs that the attacker may know are
      vulnerable to an attacker standing up an access point with the same SSID
      and PSK. This is not specific to OWE, it affects all WiFi networks.</t>

      <t>This solution does not (directly) protect against disassociation
      attacks and the attacker observing the client authentication. This is
      not specific to OWE.</t>

      <t>This solution does not claim to provide "strong" security, it is
      intended to be less insecure than "open" WiFi. In order to avoid users
      assuming that they are getting more security than they really are, OWE
      protected networks do not get a "lock" icon then scanning for WiFi
      networks. </t>
